# üìå Smart Phishing Guard

A lightweight Chrome Extension for real-time phishing detection using machine learning models and URL/DOM feature analysis.

---

## üìñ Project Description

Smart Phishing Guard analyzes websites in real-time to detect potential phishing attempts.  
It extracts both URL and DOM features, applies machine learning models (Logistic Regression or Random Forest), and visually informs the user if a website is safe or suspicious.  
The extension also uses a whitelist for trusted domains to reduce false positives.
